Q8 - 5.2 : 
If the epsilon is set very high ( 0.95) and never decreased the agent will always choose random actions and keep exploring, as seen in the cost vs training steps chart attached along - Exploration.png - no overall decrease in cost

If the epsilon is set very low ( 0.05) to begin with the agent will always greedily choose the best explored action when there might be better actions available that have not been explored. As seen in the exploitation chart attached along - Exploitation.png - gradual decrease in cost

Q8 - 5.3 :
Even without accurate Q values, the optimal Q value should only be greater than other actions in the state for it to be chosen.
